OVERVIEW -

This project is the submission of Hackanova 2.0 under open innovation track. The problem statement of this project is 'Analizing the Carbon Emmission due to tech-stacks used in IT industry'.

We are aware of carbon emmission due to all other factors and society seems to be stepping towards its deduction.But, very few are aware that the industry which seems to be clean and white can release more black(carbon).
The use of IT software leads to significant energy, time and space consumption,
which can result in a large amount of carbon emissions, either directly or
indirectly. Currently, there is no established method for measuring and
analyzing the carbon footprint of these software products, which are commonly
used in our daily lives.

Our goal is to create an application that can evaluate and analyze the
carbon emissions of various software products, and offer suggestions for
reducing emissions by making adjustments to technical specifications
without compromising the product's value.
The application will be designed for both those who are planning to
develop a software product and those who have already developed one,
allowing users to set environmental protection goals before and after
development.

TOOLS USED - 
● Data Collection: Web scraping techniques from industry reports and
scientific journals.
● Data Analysis & Visualization: Power BI
● Database Management: Firebase
● Application Development: Web Development using ReactJS and NextJS

Using this project as the computer engineering professionals , we will be able to contribute to global efforts to combat the climate change .
